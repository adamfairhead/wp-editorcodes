# WP Shortcodes

This repo contains any shortcodes I find myself needing over and over; things that may be useful for content editors when structuring content in the WYSIWYG.

Currently contains:

#### sc-button
This plugin basically drops a button into the WYSIWYG editor. The editor can specify a URL and anchor text. The classes can be set on the button in the sc_button.php file.

#### sc-hr
This plugin simply adds a horizontal rule with a click.

#### sc-lead
This plugin wraps a paragraph with lead tags. The output of this is a paragraph with the class "lead". This plays nice out of the box with Foundation's lead styles.
